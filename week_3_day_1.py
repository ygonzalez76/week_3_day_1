# # Week3
# # This week we will work on :
# # Working With Strings


# # 1.   Working With Numbers
# # 2.   Getting Input From Users




# # 1.   Building a Basic Calculator
# # 2.   Mad Libs Game




































# # Review
# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age = 16 #integer string
# 2. name
name = "Yailyn" #string variable
# 3. song
song = "Chicken wing" #string variable
# 4. food
food = "balogna" #string variable
# 5. number
number = 21 #integer variable



# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...


# Once upon a time, there was a [age] old coder named [name].
print("Once upon a time, there was a " + str(age) + " year old coder named " + name + ".")

# [name] liked to hum the song [song] while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw [food] until [name] would stop singing.
print((name) + " liked to hum the song " + (song) + " while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would throw " + (food) + " until " + (name) + " would stop singing.")


print("Still, " + (name) + " was the best coder on the team and could write " + str(number) + " lines of code every day. Maybe " + (song) + " was " + (name) + "â€™s secret power?")

number1= 100
number2= 200
number3= 300
number4= 400
number5= 500
#put all of these into a sentence

# print(str(number) + "." + str(number1) + "," + str(number2) + str(number4) + "," + str(number5))

print(f"{number}.{number1},{number2},{number3},{number4},{number5}")

# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh),
#    or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
# 6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"


# Here are some exercises to practice the rules:


# Correcting Invalid Names: Below are some invalid names. Correct them according to the rules:


# first_name
# last_name
# email_address
# percent
# variable_name
# zero
# list_of_names
# Creating Valid Names: Create valid names for the following descriptions:


# The first name of a person
# The last name of a person
# The email address of a person
# The percentage of marks obtained by a student
# A variable to store the number of items in a shopping cart




# Identify Valid and Invalid Names: Identify which of the following names are valid or invalid according to the rules:


# first_name
# lastName
# email_address
# percentage
# variable_name
# first_variable
# email_address
# percentage
# instagram

# # **Working with** **numbers** **bold text**
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.

# #addition
# #multiplication
# #division
# #modulo
# #powers
# #get the max and min of a number
# #round a number
# # absolute value
# # order of operations
# #to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
# #from math import *    
# #this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
# #floor method
# #ceil method
# #sqrt method

# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# # **Getting Input from users**
# #how do we get input from users?
# input("what is your name?")
# # basic math calculator
# #ask the user for 2 numbers
# # print out a statement where you:
# # add them together
# #multiply
# # find the max number
# # find the remainder of the numbers
# #round one number
